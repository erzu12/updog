## What's Updog?
Nothing much, what's up with you? <br>

Updog is a messenger application with integrated AI functionality to detect bullying and to provide a clever answer to it. <br>
This project was created during the [HackStair FS2023](https://hack.stair.ch/) hackathon by : <br>

## Why Updog?
In today's social media world, bullying is a big problem. <br>
We want to help people who are bullied by providing them with a clever answer to the bully's message. <br>
This way, the bullied person can respond to the bully without having to think about a clever answer. <br>
This can help to defuse the situation and to prevent the bullied person from being further bullied. <br>
Updog is also able to generate a normal response to a message, when that social anxiety kicks in and you don't know what to say. <br><br>
**Use Updog today and improve your mental health and social life! <br>**
